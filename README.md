# Smart Academic Task & Deadline Analytics System
A web-based application designed to help students and faculty manage academic tasks, track deadlines, and analyze workload distribution using simple analytics and visual dashboards.

# Problem It Solves
Students often struggle with overlapping deadlines and poor task prioritization. Faculty lack visibility into workload congestion across courses. Existing tools are either complex or not analytics-focused. This system provides a simple, centralized solution for task tracking and workload analysis.

# Target Users (Personas)
- Student: Wants to track assignments and avoid missing deadlines.
- Faculty Member: Wants to analyze workload trends and avoid deadline clustering.
- Admin: Manages users and courses.

# Vision Statement
To provide a simple, analytics-driven academic planning tool that improves time management and reduces deadline-related stress for students and faculty.

# Key Features / Goals 
- Task and deadline management
- Workload analytics (weekly/monthly)
- Visual dashboards
- Role-based access (student, faculty, admin)
- Simple and intuitive UI

# Success Metrics
- Users can track all tasks without external tools
- Analytics correctly highlight high-workload periods
- At least 80% of users can use the system without guidance

# Assumptions & Constraints
